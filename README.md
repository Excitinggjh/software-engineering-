## This is the final assignment of the Introduction to Software Engineering 
### Task 1 
C++, Java Coding Specification and Example 
### Task 2
Choose an appropriate software system, make a careful analysis of the system, write the corresponding software requirements specifications, specific\
`requirements:`\
(1) Referring to the corresponding template, the corresponding content must be complete; \
(2) A detailed introduction of the system must be included. \
(3) Functional requirements are the key points. In this part, there must be corresponding use case diagrams and corresponding use case scenarios. 
### Task 3
On the basis of requirement specifications completed in Task 2, object-oriented analysis and design are carried out, and corresponding software outline design and detailed design documents are compiled.\
`Specific requirements are as follows:` \
(1) Referring to the corresponding template, the corresponding content must be complete; \
(2) Referring to Lecture 11, the design of the software architecture must be included in the outline design, which is similar to the corresponding system structure design diagram on page 31.\
(3) Identify the entity class, boundary class and control class of the system, draw the class diagram of the system, each class diagram contains complete data and function members, and draw the relationship between class and class.
